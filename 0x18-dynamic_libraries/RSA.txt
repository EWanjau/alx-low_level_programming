Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
Usage:
    factors <file>
file contains the numbers one per line
valid natural numbers greater than 1
no empty space or line before or after the number
file ends with a new line

Output:
        n = p * q
        one factorization per line
        p, q are not prime numbers necessarily
        no dependencies
        executable file called, factors
